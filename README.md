# HappyTreeResearchFriends
Here I will store some learning contents, learning pathways, and opportunities so that I can re-use them. Happy Tree Research Friends is a group that I started three years ago with my mentee and friends.

I will look through different contents to choose the most efficient ones. You can also find good content for each topic in the outline.

Colour guide: For your initial start of each section first see green circle 🟢. You can do something after finishing green circles, and by starting early, you will learn more deeply. After some initial experience, you can continue learning blue dots 🔵, which are important but for intermediate levels, and white circles 🔘, which are optional content. I also provided some deep content in orange circles 🟠, but I don't believe that these things will help you (i.e. they are not cost-effective). Remember that I am a practical person, with the learning-by-doing style of learning things. You should become familiar with your learning style and strengths, then modify any recommendations.

  <summary>Soft Skills - Project Management</summary>

    <summary>Project Management - Fundamentalse </summary>
    This is one of the most critical skills, which is also among most rare skillsets I could find or develop among my mentees. It needs a mixture of EQ + communication skills + context knowledge. These contents will help you to learn some basics, but remember, the key to being a competent project manager is to increase your coping skills in a real-world challenge.
    
  - Start with this video: [10 Project Management Terms You Need to Know (14 min) 🟢](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTEK0BmsH-g)
  - Continue with this video, which talks about general PM: [Introduction to Project Management (45 min) 🟢](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0kUfDLXqPE)
  - And this one is so practical: [Project Management Simplified (50 min) 🔵](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKOL-rZ79gs)

 To continue learning more deeply you can see the best video course on this topic by David McLachlan (strongly recommended as the only thing you should see after green dots):
 
 - [The PMBOK Video Course (12 hours) 🔵🔵🔵](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEWFSKHjyrwz_UKPl-jeSan5NU7RH3KRD)
- You can also see the Google course or any other book or video you can find, **but remember, you can learn it only by acting as a project manager**. To get your first PM role **you need INTEREST + COMMITMENT + START SMALL**. [Google Full  Course on PM on YT (16 hours) 🟠](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTZYG7bZ1u6puLWxUtqAjZkIB4dB_JFzk). They also have [FULL Coursera course(160 hours) 🟠](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management) course if you are a paper-certificates fan. (I guess the Google course is not cost-benefit)

  <summary> Project Management - Styles </summary>
  You should choose your leadership/management approach based on (a) your project aim, (b) the personality of your team, (c) your environment, and (d) your own personality and skill portfolio. There is a trade-off between team development and project progress. In my opinion, the only way out of this matrix is to talk to people and mention the aims of the project and this trade-off (for example, you can say this project is 70% progress-based and 30% team-development-based because of ..., just talk to people (be transparent and polite), and let them choose if their benefits outweigh their costs. This will solve many things, believe me. 
  
  This short video can give you a grasp of PM styles:

    <summary> Project Management - Widgets </summary>
    You should store all project information in one place, and that's Google Docs (with links to Google Sheets). Avoid using paid services or any other software, Google Apps can do all the things you want to do, and you can easily manage the access. These are minimum must-haves for every project:

 - 1- SUPERHERO of PM, Gantt Chart or Planning Timeline: In Gantt charts, you will estimate each step of each project so that you can define deadlines, and required resources, and reflect on your progress. First, write the big phases of the project, and then break them into smaller phases. You should mention who will do this task, when (s)he will do it, and what is the satisfactory metric (when you are satisfied with the final output). It's fine to change these estimated times as the project progresses, but you should have them.

    <summary> Project Management - Communication </summary>
    This is the hardest part of PM. You learned how to define a project, what is PM fundamentals and its styles, and what tools you need to do PM, but all of these steps will fail if you can't work and communicate with people. In my opinion, your success is heavily dependent on your previous life experiences (the number of travels you had, the wide range of people you talked to, etc) and your talent. You can improve your skills for sure. The only advice I have is to be transparent and think about each scenario at first, and discuss your solution directly with all team members at the beginning of the project. Some challenges as a project manager are: how you gonna find out someone is the right person, how you gonna tell them what they should do, how you will provide positive and negative feedback, how you can help members improve their performance, and finally when you should stop working with them and how you gonna do that. On the other side, you are not a project manager, but a people regulator, so other issues that you should think of are: why people should work on this project, why people should work with you, would you work with yourself, how you can make sure that people will be rewarded fairly. In one word, good luck :) I hope these contents help you to have some general idea about communication:
