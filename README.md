Welcome to the repository of learning resources, pathways, and opportunities curated for the Happy Tree Research Friends community. Founded three years ago with my mentee and friends, Happy Tree Research Friends is a collaborative group that facilitates continuous learning and growth.

Within this repository, you'll find carefully selected learning materials and pathways to support your educational journey. Our color-coded guide ensures efficient navigation:

ðŸŸ¢ Green circles indicate essential starting points. Begin here to build foundational knowledge and skills.
ðŸ”µ Blue dots represent intermediate-level content, providing further depth and insight into various topics.
ðŸ”˜ White circles denote optional resources, offering additional learning opportunities for those interested.
ðŸŸ  Orange circles highlight deeper content. While valuable, these resources may be more specialized and require careful consideration of their relevance to your learning objectives.
As a practical advocate of the learning-by-doing approach, I encourage you to explore and adapt these recommendations according to your individual learning style and strengths. Let's embark on this journey of continuous improvement together.
